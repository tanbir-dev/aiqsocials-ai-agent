# 🚀 Deployment Guide for Sarah

This guide outlines the steps to deploy your intelligent agent **Sarah** on GenSpark or equivalent platforms. It's optimized for modular builds, context-efficient prompts, and future scalability.

---

## 📁 Prerequisites

Before deployment, ensure the following:
- GenSpark account with access to **SuperAgent**.
- Finalized agent logic (modular, context-efficient).
- Stable internet connection and browser compatibility.
- Optional: External backups of your prompt logic in `.md`, `.json`, or `.yaml` formats.

## 🧠 Step 1: Build & Structure Sarah

1. **Define Core Intents**:
   - Greeting
   - Help & Escalation
   - Ethical Gatekeeping
   - Fallback & Clarifications

2. **Modularize Logic** (Recommended for scaling):
   - Use nested prompt blocks or callable subroutines if supported.
   - Limit repetition and keep context windows lean.

3. **User Context Mapping**:
   - Define persistent traits (name, preferences, memory rules).
   - Ensure privacy boundaries are respected.

---

## 🔄 Step 2: Testing Before Deployment

- Use GenSpark's "Test Agent" feature.
- Validate edge cases: empty input, ambiguous queries, ethical triggers.
- Collect debug logs and refine prompt responses.

---

## 🌐 Step 3: Deploy

1. **Click "Deploy" or "Share Agent"** from GenSpark dashboard.
2. Choose visibility:
   - **Private Use**: Personal assistant mode.
   - **Public Access**: Offer to clients or publish link.
3. Monitor analytics for user queries and fallback triggers.

## 🛠 Step 4: Maintenance & Iteration

- Regularly prune token-heavy conversations.
- Add checkpoint exports after major updates.
- Use Copilot (👋 that’s me!) to brainstorm revisions or rework prompt behavior live.

## 📦 Optional Enhancements

| Feature                | Purpose                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Feedback Logger        | Improve user satisfaction        |
| Intent Parser          | Smarter intent detection         |
| Ethical Filter Module  | Keep responses aligned to values |
| Multilingual Support   | Expand user base                 |

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

> **Issue:** "Context Length Exceeded"  
> **Fix:** Trim logs, split session, use modular prompts, reopen project in fresh session.

> **Issue:** Agent not responding post-deploy  
> **Fix:** Check trigger configuration, browser console errors, or rollback to previous version.
